        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>The Valleylight Academy, a body corporate established by Dr. Telvin Gateru Karogo is the pioneer institution of higher education in Kenya and the region.

The only institution of higher learning in Kenya for a long time, the Valleylight Academy responded to the national regional and Africa's high level manpower training needs by developing and evolving strong, diversified academic programmes and specializations in sciences, applied sciences, technology, humanities, social sciences and the arts. To date, the range of programmes offered number approximately two hundred.

Through module II (continuing education) programmes, invaluable opportunity has been opened to hundreds of Kenyans and non-Kenyans, on a paying basis, who meet our admission requirements, but who have not been able to access university education due to restricted intake into the regular programmes that is determined by limited resource allocation by Government.

In this effort, the location of the seven campuses of the school in the capital city and its environs and facilitating easy access, has been an asset that has seen the school increasingly become the busy hub and citadel of academic activity at all times.

In addition to the regular and evening and weekend programmes, classes are conducted at the school's Extra Mural Centres located at the country's provincial headquarters.

The school is proud of its distinguished record of achievements in teaching, research, development and consultancy while strategizing for a greater future as the centre of academic, research and professional excellence.</p>

              <li><i class="bi bi-check-circle"></i>Curriculum</li>
              <p>In the first 2 years at the school, a student has to take the following compulsory subjects – Mathematics, Languages (English and Kiswahili), Sciences (Biology, Chemistry and Physics), Geography, History and Christian Religious Education. On top of this, the student also has to choose one of the following optional subjects – Agriculture, Business Studies, French, Computer Studies, German or Music. Upon entering form three, the student can take a minimum of 7 subjects to be examined in the K.C.S.E as per the Kenya National Examinations Council (K.N.E.C) guidelines. Most of the students, however, take 8 subjects.</p>
              <li><i class="bi bi-check-circle"></i> Our history.</li>
              <p>Moi High School Kabarak is a co-educational school located in Kabarak, Nakuru County, Kenya, and has a rich history. The school was established in 1979 as a mixed boarding school by the Late President Daniel Moi, who is one of the longest-serving leaders in Kenya's history. The school was named after the nearby Kabarak Farm owned by President Moi.

In the early days, the school's vision was to provide affordable education to Kenyan children and to prepare them well for college and life. The school started with a small student population and a small number of teachers. However, over the years, the school's reputation grew, making it one of the most highly regarded schools in the country.

In the years since its founding, Valleylight Academy has undergone significant changes. In the 1990s, the school introduced a primary school and later, a kindergarten. The primary school has since become a feeder school to the high school. The school also introduced a new curriculum to the high school, which emphasizes holistic education that is aimed at producing well-rounded students with leadership skills.

One of the most significant changes to the school occurred in 2002. After President Moi retired from politics, the management of the school was handed over to a board of governors. At the same time, the school started to register students directly with the Ministry of Education, marking the end of an era in which the school had been a private institution.

Over the years, Valleylight Academy has produced a large number of successful alumni, who have gone on to excel in various fields. The school has also participated in academic and sporting events at both national and international levels. For example, the school has sent students to represent Kenya in international competitions such as the World Scholar's Cup, the International Mathematical Olympiad, and the International Physics Olympiad.

Currently, Moi High School Kabarak has over 2,000 students, both male and female, and offers a wide range of academic programs. The school also offers a variety of extracurricular activities, including sports, music, and drama.

Moi High School Kabarak has a rich history of providing quality education to Kenyan children. The school has undergone significant changes, transitioning from a private institution to a school that is directly registered with the Ministry of Education. Despite these changes, the school's commitment to providing an affordable, holistic education that is aimed at producing well-rounded students has remained unchanged, making it one of the most highly regarded schools in the country.

                      “It is difficult to articulate how profoundly my time at the Academy helped to shape the person I am and the decisions I have made. The education I received was spectacular, and the professors at the Academy gave me unique and intense learning experiences in the fields of political sciences, history, and the humanities, for which I am incredibly grateful. However, I am even more grateful for the critical thinking and problem‐solving skills the Academy helped me to develop. Professors constantly made me know both what I believed and made me be able to defend why, and I relied on those skills constantly throughout law school. The Academy gave me the endurance to continue through challenges and the confidence to know I was fully equipped to handle whatever those challenges might be.”

                    “When I think back about the time I spent at Howard Payne, I realize that I cannot separate it from my involvement in the Academy. Some of my fondest memories, toughest assignments, and most rewarding struggles came from my experiences in the Academy, and I know without a doubt that my time at Howard Payne would not have been nearly as fulfilling had I not participated in the honors program. More valuable even than the memories and the triumphs, however, was the education that I received from the Academy. I recently started graduate school, and although the years ahead will be difficult I know that I am fully prepared and capable to face any challenge that may arise. The professors in the Academy not only gave me an invaluable education, but they also taught me how to seek out knowledge, learn things for myself, and never settle for less than my best effort. The Academy not only taught me the skills I need to thrive in graduate school, but it also gave me the confidence to pursue my dreams.”
